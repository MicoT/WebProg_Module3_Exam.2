            <h3 class="head1">Who am I?</h3>
                
            <p class="text1">Hello! I am Jace Javellana, I am 20 years old and am currently a 2nd year Information Systems student in Malayan Colleges Mindanao. I see myself as a reserved and quiet individual who opens up more once you get to know me better. My favorite color is blue, and my favorite band is a band called “Sure Sure”. I generally enjoy listening to different genres of music and love to play video games like League of Legends and Fallout to name a few. In my spare time, I also like to exercise, watch anime, read manga, and have recently picked up jump roping and added it to my routine. I also like playing a lot of different games with my friends like card games such as Magic the gathering, and tabletop games like Dungeons and Dragons.  Currently, as a student of this field I am still a work in progress and am working on getting better everyday.</p>

            <p class="text2">By the time I am 30, I am hoping to have a stable job to help support my friends and family, have traveled around different parts of the globe, and am looking forward to owning a house by then. I am also hoping to find genuine happiness and a purpose in life by that time I have reached that age. </p>
