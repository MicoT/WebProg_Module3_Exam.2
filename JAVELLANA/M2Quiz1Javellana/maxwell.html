                Maxwell Maltz (March 10, 1899 – April 7, 1975[1]) was an American cosmetic surgeon and author of Psycho-Cybernetics (1960), which was a system of ideas that he claimed could improve one's self-image leading to a more successful and fulfilling life. He wrote several books, among which Psycho-Cybernetics was a long-time bestseller — influencing many subsequent self-help teachers.His orientation towards a system of ideas that would provide self-help is considered the forerunner of the now popular self-help books.
